### Little collection of stable diffusion things

This collection of notebooks is meant to help testing prompts and parameters.
You will need an installation of [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
with enabled [API](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/API)

You will also need a working installation of jupyter lab

#### Multi Check

The jupyternotebook Multi Check is mainly used for testing stable diffusion prompts and models.
I mainly use this to check artist styles and the effect of single prompts against SD.

#### step and sampler

This notebook is used to test steps and samplers with a static prompt.
I use this to find out if I need to use a different sampler or if my steps are too high / too low
